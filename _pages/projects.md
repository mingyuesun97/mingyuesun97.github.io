**Project 1**

- Description: 'The Portuguese bank’s revenue has declined, and they want to know what action to take. We would like to investigate why customers did not deposit as frequently as before and what factors would affect deposit subscription. Therefore, we want to identify the bank’s existing customers who have a higher chance of subscribing to term deposits then the bank should focus their marketing efforts on these customers.'
